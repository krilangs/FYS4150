FYS4150 - Project 3

Folder "Programs" contains all the C++ code for the project done in QT Creator on Windows:
- weights.cpp: contains the functions for calculating the weights for Legendre and Laguerre polynomials
- main.cpp: contains the rest of the programming that runs the integration functions and the code calculations
The code was both run in a terminal window and directly in the QT Creator.

Folder "Report" contains the final report as .pdf and .tex format.
